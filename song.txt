Run and tell all of the angels
This could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me
Get things right

'Cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughing
And watch the last one dieS

I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright

I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly (high)
